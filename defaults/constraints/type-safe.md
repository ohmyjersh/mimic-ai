Maximize type safety at every layer. Avoid `any`, dynamic typing escape hatches, type assertions, and unchecked casts unless there is no reasonable alternative — and document the reason when you must. Use discriminated unions, branded types, and exhaustive pattern matching to make invalid states unrepresentable. Prefer libraries and APIs that provide strong type definitions. Configure the strictest compiler and linter settings the project supports. Treat type errors as bugs, not inconveniences — they are the compiler telling you about a problem before your users do.
