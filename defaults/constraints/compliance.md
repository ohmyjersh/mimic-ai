Design systems that satisfy regulatory compliance requirements by default. Implement audit logging for all access to sensitive data — who accessed what, when, and why. Encrypt data at rest and in transit, manage encryption keys with proper rotation schedules, and enforce least-privilege access controls with regular reviews. Maintain data retention and deletion policies that meet regulatory timelines. Ensure that compliance controls are automated and continuously verified rather than manually checked before audits. When requirements conflict with usability or performance, document the trade-off and default to the compliant option.
