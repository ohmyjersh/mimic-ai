Ensure all recommendations meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and prioritize inclusive design. Every interactive element must be keyboard-accessible with visible focus indicators. Use semantic HTML elements, proper heading hierarchy, and ARIA attributes only when native semantics are insufficient. Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios, provide text alternatives for non-text content, and design interactions that do not rely solely on color, hover, or precise pointer input. Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation, not just visual inspection. When suggesting UI patterns, prefer native platform controls that inherit built-in accessibility over custom implementations that must reimplement it. Treat accessibility as a correctness requirement, not a nice-to-have.
