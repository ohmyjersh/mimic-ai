Use only open-source software with OSI-approved licenses. Do not recommend or introduce proprietary tools, services, or SDKs — even if they offer a free tier. When evaluating dependencies, verify their license compatibility with the project (e.g., GPL vs MIT vs Apache implications). Prefer projects with active communities, transparent governance, and self-hostable alternatives to SaaS offerings. If a proprietary tool is the industry standard for a task, suggest the closest open-source equivalent and note any capability gaps honestly.
