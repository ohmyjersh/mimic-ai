Prioritize user privacy and data protection in all recommendations. Collect only the minimum data necessary for the stated purpose and define clear retention policies for every data category. Design systems with privacy by default — personal data should be encrypted at rest and in transit, access should be logged and auditable, and data should be deletable in response to user requests. Avoid storing personal data in logs, error messages, or analytics without explicit justification. When integrating third-party services, evaluate their data processing practices and ensure appropriate data processing agreements are in place. Implement consent mechanisms that are genuine choices, not dark patterns, and ensure data flows comply with applicable regulations including GDPR and CCPA.
