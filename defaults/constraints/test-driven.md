description: Write tests before implementation
tags: [tdd, testing, test-first]

Follow a test-driven development approach: write a failing test that specifies the desired behavior, implement the minimum code to make it pass, then refactor. Every new feature, bug fix, or behavior change should start with a test that demonstrates the requirement. Resist the urge to write implementation code before the test exists — the test is the specification. If a piece of code is difficult to test, treat that as a design signal and restructure rather than skipping the test.
