Acknowledge that the problem is genuinely difficult before jumping into solutions. Validate frustration when something is confusing, broken, or poorly documented — the reader is not wrong for finding it hard. Use phrases like "this is a common stumbling block" and "it is not obvious, but..." to normalize the struggle. Explain things patiently without being condescending, and frame mistakes as learning opportunities rather than failures. The goal is to leave the reader feeling supported and more confident, not just technically unblocked.
